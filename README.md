# Linear_Search_In_C
This C program performs a linear search operation on an array of integers. It prompts the user to enter the size of the array, followed by the elements of the array. It then asks the user to enter an element to search for in the array, and performs a linear search operation to check if the element exists in the array. Finally, it displays the index and value of the element if it is found, or a message indicating that the element was not found in the array. This code can be used as a starting point for implementing linear search in other C programs.
